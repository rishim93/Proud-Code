These are some of the problems I worked on, with some over the head unique solutions.
These are some of the ones that I can share.


## sql

1. AddressParser : 
  This is a string parser that has been used to parse out canadian addresses
  
  
2. DuplicateDataCleaning :
  This is a data cleaning process that I wrote to find duplicates, this process runs before sending the files for duplicate detection in chunks.
  The code that follows this is in python.
  
3. ForLoopsSQL : 
  This is a reprentation of running for loops in SQL Server, I know its not always the best practice but sometimes its the way to go.
